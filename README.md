1) Create a table. Name it as "CountryList"
2) It should have 2 columns.
	a) IDNo - int (Give it auto increment).
	b) CountryName - varchar

3) After doing so change the connection in api.
4) Open the api using visual studio and inside that go to Models folder > mdlCountryListRes.cs
5) In that file change connection acording to your sql server credentials and database name.
